# pytorch_fundamentals

Learning objectives:

- Learn how to use Tensors with CPUs and GPUs
- Understand how to manage, scale and normalize your datasets
- Build an image recognition model using a neural network
- Learn how to optimize a model
- Learn how to enhance model inference performance

## Setup

Install SkyPilot - makes the process of provisioning a machine easy:
```shell
pip install -U "skypilot[aws]"
```

Configure AWS access:
```shell
pip install boto3
aws configure
```

To get a machine with a GPU, I run the following command:

```shell
sky gpunode -p 8888 -c jupyter-vm --gpus T4:1 --cloud aws --region us-west-1 --use-spot
```

Then, on the VM, I activate the pre-configured by AWS environment:

```shell
source activate pytorch
```

After, I start the Jupyter notebook server:

```shell
jupyter notebook
```

Finally, I select kernel in my local (Codespaces) Jupyter notebook to match the http address with the token generated by the command above.
